The ventilated mask draws in fresh air through its dedicated front port featuring a filtration layer to eliminate pollen, soot, dust, and other pollutants whilst exhaust carbon dioxide is released through side vents, preventing excessive visor fog in wet or hot conditions. The Respo Mask clips on to a front chin bar.</div>

            <div class="new_modal__gr">Please note a correctly fitted helmet should feel as if an evenly distributed pressure is continuously being exerted 
            around the head and cheeks. Helmets, like shoes, will break in. For this reason, the helmet should fit as tight as you can 
            stand to wear it. Once fastened, make sure the helmet cannot be pulled off of the head in any direction.  
            If the helmet moves significantly, the helmet is too big. First time helmet buyers tend to choose helmets that 
            are too loose or too big. If the helmet does not fit well, it cannot deliver the level of protection you need.</div>
